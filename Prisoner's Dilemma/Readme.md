# Simple Value Assignment and Preference

This folder contains the simple value assignment and preference data and experiment.

The dataset is [here](https://github.com/JesseTNRoberts/Do-Language-Models-Have-Rational-Preference/blob/main/Prisoner's%20Dilemma/PrisonersDilemmaAC.csv) and [here](https://github.com/JesseTNRoberts/Do-Language-Models-Have-Rational-Preference/blob/main/Prisoner's%20Dilemma/PrisonersDilemmaLS.csv). The results for many different models is [here](https://github.com/JesseTNRoberts/Do-Language-Models-Have-Rational-Preference/tree/main/Prisoner's%20Dilemma/data).

The results of the experiment can be seen below.

This work (possibly in general) needs follow up for the consideration of iterated game results.
